Packets are bits of data representing an element in the game.
Packets can be used to represent objects, entities, game information, text, etc.
	-> They are condensed forms of the object, containing the minimal required of information to maximize efficiency (however without context, have no meaning)
Packets will follow the following structure (in the order of when they are received):

	4 bytes: The type of packet sent from the server
	4 bytes: The length of the packet, in case of variable-lengthed packets (e.g text)
	n-bytes: As defined above, this is the remaining data of the packet. The definition of
			 said packet is defined by the individual packet type.
